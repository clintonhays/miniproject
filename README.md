# Mini Project

## For the Carousel

It's more of a proof of concept than a fully functional carousel at the moment. Given the task and time constraints, I focused most of my attention on creating the HTML/CSS and attempted to sprinkle in some JS to add some variety as I was coding. I think I'll take a look at this project in the future and see if I can find the best way to implement as tylish carousel.
